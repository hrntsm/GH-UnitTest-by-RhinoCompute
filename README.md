# GH-UnitTest-by-RhinoCompute

It is not possible to unit test the Grasshopper component itself.  
However, this repository is sample how to use RhinoCompute to test Grasshopper components directly in Grasshopper from MsTest and other sources.

This will allow you to write tests for RhinoCommon and Grasshopper dependent implementations.
